## This crazy little thing called Fantomas

Hello there, thank you for visiting this website and reading these testimonials.  
Before I share mine, I would like to briefly outline one little fact so that we are on the same page. For the past six years, I have been maintaining a project called [Fantomas](https://fsprojects.github.io/fantomas/).

## What I got out of open source?

### Getting real F# experience

I began my career as a `C#` developer in a small country where `F#` was _virtually non-existent in enterprise environments_. Given the limited job prospects for F# in my area, I was hesitant to invest time in it. However, like many of us, I found that F# simply clicked for me. It was enjoyable, intuitive, and left me feeling satisfied after coding sessions.

Remote job hunting was a challenging experience, especially without any real-world experience in the software stack of my choice. Fortunately, my involvement in **maintaining an open-source project**, Fantomas, proved to be a valuable asset in interviews. In some cases, it even opened doors and gave me a **competitive advantage** when **applying** for **F# positions**.

### Meeting new people

Contributing to open-source has introduced me to _many new people_, including some great folks who share my passion for technology and with _whom I instantly connect_. Others have been **invaluable mentors**, providing guidance that has been **instrumental to my career growth**. By expanding my network in this way, I have accelerated my progress on many levels. I have discovered that geographically distant connections offer unique perspectives and opportunities that I wouldn't have had access to otherwise.

### Broaden your horizon

Being an **open-source maintainer** and **contributor** has been a **tremendously enriching experience** for me. It has exposed me to a wide range of code-bases, methodologies, and human interactions. Furthermore, it has helped me _discover my interests beyond software development_. For example, I have given talks on Fantomas and found that I genuinely enjoy _public speaking_. In recent years, I have been focused on improving the _onboarding experience_ for new developers. This involves writing better documentation, restructuring code for easier comprehension, and organizing information in a more structured manner for others to benefit from. Moving forward, I aim to hone my skills in **extracting and sharing knowledge** in a more effective and accessible way.

## Why community is important?

### More seats at the table

I firmly believe that having **more people deeply involved in a project can take it to new heights**. This has been evident with Fantomas. Recently, more individuals have gained a deeper understanding of the tool's workings. This is excellent news because the project should not revolve solely around me. While I never asked for that, it happens when there are no co-maintainers.

Having more people with profound knowledge leads to _better design conversations_ and expands the boundaries of what _one person can maintain versus what an international group_ can achieve. This significantly impacts the project's possibilities. Moreover, having more people to respond to questions, issues, and releases has been beneficial for my sanity, as it provides a second wind instead of leading to burnout.

As a contributor to a project, having more people involved is also advantageous. It is easier to identify _missing documentation when multiple individuals face the same problem_. If you are the only contributor, your initial reaction might be, "Oh no, I'm not smart enough for this." Similarly, if maintainers label your issue as low-priority, it helps to have fellow contributors who disagree and provide support.

### Survival of OSS

**Open-source software (OSS) thrives when more people are involved** in maintaining it. I've personally experienced this with Fantomas. There were several occasions when I contemplated quitting as it was taking a toll on me. _I felt overwhelmed, used, and struggled to see the bigger picture._ These are common thoughts that many maintainers face. While some people urged me to keep going, what truly made a difference was **not having to bear the weight of the world on my own**.

### There is always room for one more

**Every project can benefit from any offer of help**, no matter how healthy it may seem. In the case of Fantomas, it has been working for many users for years and may appear to be well taken care of. However, there is always room for improvement and contributions are welcome. I believe that even though we have made progress, we still have much to do. So, I always _welcome the next contributor with open arms_, regardless of whether they have a specific idea in mind or not. If you are unsure about what to work on, just ask us: we are happy to give suggestions!
