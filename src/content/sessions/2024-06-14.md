## Topic

In F#, the file order is crucial. Sometimes, you need to rearrange the files before you can use a function from another file. Currently, in Ionide, this requires manually editing the `fsproj` file.

In this session, Jack will demonstrate how to create a drag and drop mechanism in Ionide for easier file ordering.
