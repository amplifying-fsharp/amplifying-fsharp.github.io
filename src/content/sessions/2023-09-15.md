## Topic

Houston will show us two very interesting projects he is working on:

He's building a solar panel "tracker" that dynamically positions throughout the day in order to maximize the amount of power collected.  
The (F#) code will run on a WildernessLabs Meadow microcontroller, which is both measuring the position of the panel while controlling its position with a motor control. Since the angles for a given time-of-day change throughout the year, this will end up being a dynamic control that depends on date and location, all of which the microcontroller must collect in order to "do its job" accurately.  
It's an interesting problem that requires some pretty involved math - so it's a nice combination of "theory" that's grounded in a recognizable real-world scenario.

The second project is about measuring volatile organic compounds (VOC) that uses Elmish on the Meadow board.
