## Topic

F# can be a bit challenging for newcomers, but as a community, we are dedicated to ensuring that newcomers have a fantastic experience with F#. As part of our commitment, we aim to enhance the clarity and helpfulness of warning or error messages to guide users in understanding their code mistakes better.

During this session, our focus will be on [expanding an existing message](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/1091) to provide comprehensive feedback to users regarding what went wrong in their code. By improving the error message, we can empower users to quickly identify and address the issues they encounter, fostering a smoother learning process and a more enjoyable experience with F#.
