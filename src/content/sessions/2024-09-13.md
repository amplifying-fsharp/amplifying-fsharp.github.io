# Topic

After a long break, we're back with some new content!

One of the problems of maintaining a [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/overviews/lsp/overview/) (LSP) implementation is that it can be tedious and error-prone to be correct with the [specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/). As of version 3.17.0 of the specification, there is a [metaModel](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#metaModel) that can be used to generate the LSP implementation. In a [previous session](https://amplifyingfsharp.io/sessions/2024/01/12/) we covered [Fabulous.AST](https://github.com/edgarfgp/Fabulous.AST), a powerful library that helps you generate F# code. We've previously implemented [generating the types](https://github.com/ionide/LanguageServerProtocol/pull/49) for the LSP, but now we're going to take it a step further and generate the Client and Server interfaces for the LSP.
