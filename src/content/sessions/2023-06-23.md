## Topic

Yo, VIP
Let's kick it!

Ever since [F# 6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/whats-new-in-fsharp-6/#making-f-faster-and-more-interopable-with-task), we can utilize [Resumable Code](https://github.com/TheAngryByrd/IcedTasks).  
It is the reason we have the `task { }` computation expression.

But `Tasks` are hot right? The scintillating allure of a **"hot"** `System.Threading.Tasks.Task<'t>` lies in its ability to ignite immediate action.  
Unlike their cooler `Async` counterparts, these tasks spark into existence and embark on their mission without delay.

So can we have `Tasks` for cool cats? Yes we can! Enter [Iced Tasks](https://github.com/TheAngryByrd/IcedTasks), a library which contains additional computation expressions for the task CE.  
Learn all about `ColdTask` and friends in this session!
