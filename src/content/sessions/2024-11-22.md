# Topic

Jonas Juselius recently appeared in the Func Proc Sweden meetup [stream](https://www.youtube.com/live/5Cuv0WnbZtk) and presented about ¨Single Process Micro-service Architecture¨. The topic and presentation was so interested that Scott Wlaschin voiced his interest in an even deeper dive and discussion about it. Thus, we are having just that in this session.
