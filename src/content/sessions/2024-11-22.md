# Topic

Jonas Juselius recently appeared in the Func Proc Sweden meetup [stream](https://www.youtube.com/live/5Cuv0WnbZtk) and presented about ¨Single Process Micro-service Architecture¨. The topic and presentation was so interested that Scott Wlaschin voiced his interest in an even deeper dive and discussion about it. Thus, we are having just that in this session.

In Jonas' own words:  
Micro-service architecture is a popular design pattern among serious cloud architects. There are good reasons for using Domain-Driven Design together with the strict boundaries provided by disparate services. Unfortunately there is a price to pay: The complexity of deploying and operating multiple distinct, distributed services quickly becomes high.

In this presentation we examine the virtues of micro-services, while retaining the operational simplicity of the monolith. We present a flexible scheme based on Dapr Actors in F#, allowing us to get the best of both worlds: Strict domain boundaries, running inside a single monolith. We also show how the monolith almost trivially and transparently can be split, if hard realities dictate the need. Behold, the Single-Process Micro Service Architecture(tm)!
