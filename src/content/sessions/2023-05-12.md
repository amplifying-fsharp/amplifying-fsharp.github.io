## Topic

In this session Damian Reeves tries to update the F# Analyzers SDK to net7.0. and use the F# Analyzers to restrict the F# language.  
He will show us how to use the SDK to implement an analyzer and how to use it to restrict the F# language used in a project.  
One useful restriction could be to disallow type definitions outside of modules, as this eases porting code from Elm to F#.
