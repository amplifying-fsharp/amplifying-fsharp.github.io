# Topic

Real-time event visualization using F# and Fable

In this session we explore how to build a real-time event visualization system using F# and Fable.

### Workshop plan

- Scaffolding a project with SAFE template
- Serving the content of a file from a Saturn Web service
- Retrieving file content using HTTP requests in a Fable app
- Implementing playback of individual lines of a file
- Replacing direct calls to Fable.React with Feliz
- Adding Bulma CSS and FontAwesome to a Fable app (using CSS F# type provider)
- From file lines player to events player (parsing text lines with Thoth.Json decoder)
- Implementing event subscriptions using Web sockets (and Elmish.Bridge)
- Adding live tiles (presentation of state changes)
- Using Redux DevTools with Fable applications
