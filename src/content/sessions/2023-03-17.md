## Problem

I frequently work with named fields in discriminated unions when I'm pattern matching.
An example use case:
<img alt="No intellisense when using named fields in discriminated unions" class="img-fluid" src="/images/sessions/namedPatternIntellisense.gif"/>

Notice I didn't have any proper autocomplete for the names inside my current discrimination union.
I had to look them up in the [documentation](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-compiler-docs/reference/fsharp-compiler-syntax-synexpr.html#ObjExpr), which isn't the best editing experience.

## Expected behavior

It be nice if my editor gave me a list with all the named fields.
<small>
(In case of `SynExpr.ObjExpr` that would be `objType, argOptions, withKeyword, bindings, members, extraImpls, newExprRange, range`)
</small>

In this example, I'll be using JetBrains Rider as my IDE, and we'll be exploring how to extend its code completion infrastructure.  
While I'm not an expert on this topic, I have contributed to Rider in the past and can provide a solid introduction to the subject.
