## Topic

Improve compiler error inside CE for missed match case

Currently the following error reported in multiple scenarios inside CE:

<img alt="match expressions missing inside task ce confusing error" class="img-fluid" src="/images/sessions/ce-error-reporting.png"/>

In this specific case the reason is just the missing `_` in: `| _ ->`, which is misleading is this scenario.

The goal of the session is to improve the error reporting in this scenario.
