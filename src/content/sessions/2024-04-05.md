## Topic

Looking at the [\*.fsl](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/blob/main/src/Compiler/lex.fsl) or [\*.fsy](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/blob/main/src/Compiler/pars.fsy) file of the F# compiler can be a bit intimidating. After all, they need to parse the entire F# language!  
So that might be a bit much for a fslexyacc beginner.
Let's switch gears and start with something simpler: a very small language with a syntax we can easily keep in our brain's working memory.

We will use [fslexyacc](https://fsprojects.github.io/FsLexYacc/) to generate a lexer and a parser for it. Along the way, we'll learn about the most important concepts, such as tokens, rules and actions.  
To fully enjoy our creation, we will use the generated AST as the input of a simple interpreter for our language.
