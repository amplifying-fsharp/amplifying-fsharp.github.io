## Topic

You expect your IDE to work well with your code. You expect it to provide you with code completion, navigation, and refactoring, highlighting, and so on.  

But what if your code is broken?  
What if it doesn't compile?  
What if it's not even valid code?  

In fact, your code is broken most of the time during editing, without you even realizing it.  
That's where parser recovery comes in. It's a technique that allows IDEs to work with broken code.  
Recently, Eugene Auduchinok has made great improvements to parser recovery in the F# compiler and he wants to share his experience with us.
