## Topic

Alright, astronauts, buckle up because we're launching into orbit! Not long ago, we embarked on a journey exploring the seamless integration of [Fable and Vite](./2023-02-23.md). Now, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) isn't just everyone's new favorite web server; it's also the powerhouse under the hood of a variety of projects. Among these stars is [Astro](https://astro.build/), which is powering up the universe's fastest websites, client-side applications, dynamic API endpoints, and everything in-between.

Guess what? The site you're currently exploring? Built with Astro! Yes, Astro is not just good; it's stellar and supports interactive Islands too. Our site is currently utilizing JavaScript and React for these, and in this adventure, we're looking to weave some Fable into the fabric of our cosmos!
