## Topic

OpenTelemetry is a powerful tool for instrumenting your applications. It allows you to collect telemetry data from your applications/tests and send it to various backends for analysis.
In this session, we will explore how to use OpenTelemetry in your test suite to verify that your application is emitting the correct telemetry data.

We will use FsAutoComplete as an example and show how we can use OpenTelemetry to verify that the telemetry data emitted by the application is correct.
