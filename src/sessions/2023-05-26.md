## Topic

Functional programming is known and loved for its simplicity and conciseness. Even if many developers have not yet had contact with pure or "functional-first" languages, their ideas and concepts have long since found their way into mainstream languages and it is hard to imagine devloping without them.
Well-known are, for example, LINQ (.Net) or map/filter in JS/TS in the context of lists, through which a calculation is described by assembling individual building blocks (i.e. stateless functions). This principle works well and is very comfortable to use.
But let us think of systems such as user interfaces, (recurrent) neural networks, digital signal processing (DSP), simulation of complex systems, game engines or persistable functions, which inherently consist of building blocks that are based on their own (changing) values of past evaluations.
Here, known principles of functional programming seem to reach their limits. Recourse to objects - i.e. uniquely addressable, changeable data, revisitable multiple times or by multiple viewers - seems unavoidable here, and even if composability and predictability are also possible with objects if modelled carefully, their use lead to noticeable and unavoidable disadvantages.

The lecture shows an alternative to object-oriented programming with the aim of combining the familiar comfort of functional programming with the fundamental characteristics of stateful systems. It doesn't take much: a little clarification of terms followed by live coding illustrates the incredible versatility of F#, which, according to the speaker, resides in the "sweet spot of practicality".

P.S.: This is the first of two lectures on the basics and practical principles. In the second lecture, a prototype of a React-like UI library based on the ideas from Vide-4-Fable will be developed in live coding.
