## Topic

FSharp scripts are a great way to quickly prototype and test ideas. However including external dependencies is not as straightforward as it could be. You can reference nuget packages using `#r nuget:MyExternalDependency` but what if you want to reference you projects locally? You can build your projects directly and reference the `dll` but wouldn't it be great to do something simple like `#r fsproj: src/MyLocalProject/MyLocalProject.fsproj`? In this session we'll:

- Review the current state of referencing Fsproj files in F# scripts
- Discuss the current implementation and its limitations
- Explore current blockers
- Consider the pros and cons of contributing to fsharp or creating a community project
