## Topic

The release of .NET 8 is just a few weeks away, meaning version 8 of F# is also just around the corner.  
In this very special session, the F# team itself will talk about what the .NET world can expect from this release.  
A lot of great work from the team members and the community has been done to make this the best version of F# to date:

- New language features
- Performance improvements
- Better tooling support

Let's have a tour of what's to come from the very heart of F#.
