## Topic

> A signature file contains information about the public signatures of a set of F# program elements, such as types, namespaces, and modules. It can be used to specify the accessibility of these program elements.

&horbar; [Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/signature-files)

Signature files are a great way to document your code and to make sure that your code is only exposing the parts that you want to expose.  
But writing them can be a bit of a pain. You have to write them by hand, and you have to keep them in sync with your code.

There is the `--allsigs` compiler flag to generate signature files. However, this has a few drawbacks:

- It only uses the typed tree information, so it doesn't know about the original written implementation code.
- It prefixes absolutely everything. There is not an open-statement in sight.
- Any fix to `--allsigs` would have to be done in the compiler, which needs a new SDK release to get to you.

### Telplin

[Telplin](https://nojaf.com/telplin/docs/index.html) tries to address these limitations by taking the point of view of the untyped syntax tree.  
Meaning that it can see the original code, and it can see the open-statements.  
It will use [Fantomas.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Fantomas.Core) and [FSharp.Compiler.Service](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Compiler.Service) to access the best of worlds and create a authentic signature file.

This session will cover an overview of how Telplin works. How it leverages the F# compiler and Fantomas both programmatically.  
So, even if you are a bit skeptical of using signature files, there will definitely be something to learn.
