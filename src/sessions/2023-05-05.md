## Topic

To move the discussion of [F# RFC FS-1094 - immarray as FSharp.Core collection](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/main/RFCs/FS-1094-immarray.md) forward, we will try to make progress with the [implementation](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/12859) of a proposed syntax for it.
The proposed syntax is

```fsharp
[: :]
```

Even though, the discussion about the final syntax is not finished yet, this session should provide a good learning opportunity about compiler internals which are affected by such a change.
