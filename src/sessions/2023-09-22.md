## Topic

We will like to discuss and fix the following issue:

[Indexer/property is allowed to have mismatched value type ](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/9232)

```fsharp
type T() =
    member x.Item
        with get (index: int): string = ""
        and set (index: int) (value: float) = ()
```

The above code compiles, but it should not. The setter should have a string as a value type.

Quote from the issue from the F# language designer:

> This was never particularly intended, though I was aware since F# 1.x that it was possible. We should have added a check back then.
> I'm sure there is some code that gives wrong types but I think we can consider this a bug. I'd propose we emit a warning and consider protecting it with a langversion switch
> It's possible that this would be considered a breaking change, though I'd take the position that it's a bug fix for unintended behaviour. Because it is a benign problem (the types are still checked on each use) I think it's better to emit a warning for this than an error.
> The above code compiles, but it should not. The setter should have a string as a value type.

Possible solutions:

- Reuse the existing warning for mismatched types in members
- Create a new warning for this specific case
- Add a lang-version switch to control the warning
