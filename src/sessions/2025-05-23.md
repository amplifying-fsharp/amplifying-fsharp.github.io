## Topic

While functional, type-safe programming is a good starting point for the correctness of a program, it's still far away from a safe bet. Formal proofs still shine here. But proof systems still often suffer from being disconnected from the original code.

Wouldn't it be great to have a proof checker embedded in F#?

Hold your type and enter [Wybe](https://github.com/lamg/wybe), a proof checker embedded in F#'s computation expressions.
