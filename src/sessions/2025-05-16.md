## Topic

F# has always prioritized backward compatibility, making migration paths straightforward. This is why [FSharp.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Core) targets `netstandard2.0`, ensuring broad compatibility across various .NET runtimes.

However, more recent .NET runtime versions introduce new performance opportunities that `netstandard2.0` can't fully leverage â€“ think new primitives like `Span<'T>` or `ValueOption<'T>`. This is where [FSharp.Core.Extended](https://github.com/vzarytovskii/FSharp.Core.Extended) comes in. This library aims to be a drop-in _alternative_ for `FSharp.Core`, offering functions that are generally faster and more flexible by utilizing these newer features. It's worth noting that while it's a drop-in _replacement_ in terms of providing similar functionality, these performance gains might introduce runtime or compile-time incompatibilities compared to the original `FSharp.Core`.

We're excited to have Vlad, the former guardian of F#, here to talk about this interesting project!
