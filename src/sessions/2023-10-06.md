## Topic

In this session we will discuss the current state of the F# ecosystem for desktop and mobile development focusing on:

- Discuss the current state of [Fabulous](https://github.com/fabulous-dev)

```fsharp
/// A simple Counter app

type Model =
    { Count: int }

type Msg =
    | Increment
    | Decrement

let init () =
    { Count = 0 }

let update msg model =
    match msg with
    | Increment -> { model with Count = model.Count + 1 }
    | Decrement -> { model with Count = model.Count - 1 }

let view model =
    VStack(spacing = 16.) {
        Button("Increment", Increment)
        Button("Decrement", Decrement)
        TextBlock($"Count is {model.Count}")
    }

#if MOBILE
    let app model = SingleViewApplication(view model)
#else
    let app model = DesktopApplication(Window(view model))
#endif
```

- Discuss the current state of [Avalonia.FuncUI](https://github.com/fsprojects/Avalonia.FuncUI)

```fsharp
module Counter =

    type CounterState = {
        count : int
    }

    let init = {
        count = 0
    }

    type Msg =
        | Increment
        | Decrement

    let update (msg: Msg) (state: CounterState) : CounterState =
        match msg with
        | Increment -> { state with count =  state.count + 1 }
        | Decrement -> { state with count =  state.count - 1 }

    let view (state: CounterState) (dispatch): IView =
        DockPanel.create [
            DockPanel.children [
                Button.create [
                    Button.onClick (fun _ -> dispatch Increment)
                    Button.content "click to increment"
                ]
                Button.create [
                    Button.onClick (fun _ -> dispatch Decrement)
                    Button.content "click to decrement"
                ]
                TextBlock.create [
                    TextBlock.dock Dock.Top
                    TextBlock.text (sprintf "the count is %i" state.count)
                ]
            ]
        ]
