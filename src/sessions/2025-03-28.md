## Topic

In this session, we will discuss the work on [reusing typecheck results between compiler runs](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/blob/main/docs/reusing-typechecking-results.md)
which aims to improve the performance of the F# compiler by reusing the results of typechecking between compiler runs.
