## Topic

In this session, we will discuss data serialization (aka 'pickling') in the F# compiler - how F# code is stored on the disc. The talk will also touch on the topic of [reusing typecheck results between compiler runs](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/blob/main/docs/reusing-typechecking-results.md), the feature which is supposed to add logic there.
which aims to improve the performance of the F# compiler by reusing the results of typechecking between compiler runs.
