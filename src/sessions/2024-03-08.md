## Topic

In this session, we address the common challenges developers face when setting up debugging environments for F#
programming, highlighting the versatility and power of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) paired with the Ionide extension.
Participants will be introduced to effective debugging strategies for F# applications, both for traditional .NET
environments and those running within a browser context. The presentation aims to demystify the debugging process,
offering practical tips and insights to enhance development workflows with F#. Attendees will gain the knowledge to
leverage VS Code and Ionide for a streamlined debugging experience, improving efficiency and problem-solving skills in
their F# projects.
