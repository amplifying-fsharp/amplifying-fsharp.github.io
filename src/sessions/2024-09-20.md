# Topic

Fantomas has historically struggled with formatting operators nicely.  
It can be inconsistent at times, and there are [open issues](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+operator) related to this.

In this session, I'd like to showcase the complexity of this topic.  
We will remove all operator code and start anew.

While we won't solve this problem in one session, it may inspire others to explore this issue further.  
We will also highlight why there is no easy fix for this problem.
