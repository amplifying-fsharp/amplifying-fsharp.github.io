## Problem

- The error range is too wide, it includes the whole `T.Instance.Method("")` expression.
- The error message is not very helpful, it doesn't tell us which overload is being called.
- This behaviour is especially bad on bigger expressions, lambda arguments, and so on, as the error hides every other error and warning inside the expression.

```fsharp
type T() =
    static member Instance = T()

    member _.Method(_: double) = ()
    member _.Method(_: int) = ()

T.Instance.Method("")
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Error :
No overloads match for method 'Method'.
Known type of argument: string  Available overloads:
 - member T.Method: double -> unit // Argument at index 1 doesn't match
 - member T.Method: int -> unit // Argument at index 1 doesn't match
```

## Expected behavior

- The error range should be limited to the `Method` call.
- The error message should be more specific, something like: `No matching overload for 'Method' with argument type 'string'`
