## Topic

While being fairly feature complete, there are Web APIs out there that show that there is still room for improvement in FsHttp.  
An issue was raised by an user with a usecase that requires multipart requests with filename metadata. This is currently not supported by FsHttp.  
In this session we'll change that by adding the needed bits to the http DSL of FsHttp.
