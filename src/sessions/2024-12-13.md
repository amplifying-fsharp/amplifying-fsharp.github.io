## Topic

The evolution of the F# language is guided by community suggestions submitted to the [fsharp/fslang-suggestions](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions) repository. While proposing a new idea is straightforward, the real challenge often lies in its implementation. As we’ve discussed in previous [sessions](../../), contributing to the F# compiler can be demanding. Even after overcoming the technical hurdles, open-source contributions require approval from maintainers to be accepted.

In this session, we’ll examine [dotnet/fsharp/#18049](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/18049) as a case study, exploring how a language suggestion made its way to implementation. Additionally, we’ll conduct a mob PR review to provide collaborative feedback on this substantial pull request.
