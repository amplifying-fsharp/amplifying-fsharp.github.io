## Problem

When the F# type-checker infers a type to be obj without annotation it does not warn.
This can lead to subtle bugs, where the programmer has forgotten to annotate a type, and the code is not doing what they expect.
We create a compiler warning that warns when obj is inferred as a type.

```fsharp
We would warn in the following case, where a is inferred to be obj because that's the most general thing it could be:

let f<'b> () : 'b =
    let a = failwith ""
    a |> unbox

The following code should not generate a warning, because a is constrained to be obj by the type argument to unbox, and b is constrained to be obj because it is of the same type as a.
let a = 5 |> unbox<obj>
let b = a
```
