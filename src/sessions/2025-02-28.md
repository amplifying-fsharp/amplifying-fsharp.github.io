## Topic

Are you building ASP.NET Core applications in F# and want to ensure they’re rock-solid? Join us for a hands-on demo of [ApiStub.FSharp](https://github.com/jkone27/fsharp-integration-tests/), a powerful library designed to streamline integration testing for ASP.NET Core apps. We’ll explore how this tool, paired with the principles outlined in Microsoft’s ASP.NET Core [integration testing guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests?view=aspnetcore-9.0), empowers F# developers to write robust, maintainable tests with ease.

In this session, we’ll dive into practical examples—setting up test fixtures, simulating HTTP requests, and verifying responses—all while leveraging F#’s concise syntax and functional power. Whether you’re new to integration testing or looking to level up your ASP.NET Core workflow, this demo will showcase actionable techniques to boost your confidence in shipping reliable F# web apps. Bring your questions, and let’s test smarter together!
