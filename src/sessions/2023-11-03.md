## Topic

FsAutocomplete has committed one of the worst sins possible, using [strings](https://eiriktsarpalis.wordpress.com/2017/02/19/youre-better-off-using-exceptions/#:~:text=Stringly%2Dtyped%20error%20handling) in the `Error` case of a `Result<'Ok, 'Error>`! This is not only a bad practice, but it also makes it impossible to use the `Error` case in a type-safe manner.

In this session we'll explore the current state of error handling in FsAutocomplete, discuss the pros and cons of various approaches, and implement a better solution.
