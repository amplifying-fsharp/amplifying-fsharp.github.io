## Topic

The F# compiler does not enforce the `AttributeTargets.Method` attribute on function bindings. This can lead to unexpected behavior when using attributes in F#.

## Problem

```fsharp

open System

[<AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method)>]
type MethodOnlyAttribute() =
  inherit System.Attribute()

[<MethodOnly>]
let functionBinding () = "I'm a function"

[<MethodOnly>]
let boundedvalue = "I'm a value"


```

#### Expected behavior

- Compilation should fail because `boundedvalue` is not a function binding; it is a let bound value.
