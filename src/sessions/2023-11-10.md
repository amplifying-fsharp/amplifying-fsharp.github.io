## Topic

As mentioned in the article ["A new F# compiler feature: graph-based type-checking"](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-new-fsharp-compiler-feature-graphbased-typechecking/#ide-tooling) the story for IDE tooling supporting signature files is lackluster. This session will explore the current state of signature file support in Ionide/FsAutocomplete and work towards generating signatures for files that don't exist and look at how to update the signature file when the source file changes.
