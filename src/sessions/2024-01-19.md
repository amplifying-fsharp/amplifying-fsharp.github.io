## Topic

In the vast and boundless ocean of the JavaScript ecosystem, Fable emerges as a mighty vessel, harnessing the power to repurpose an endless array of packages.
Yet, navigating these waters brings its own quest: to bridge the realms of JavaScript and F#, a translator must be conjured.
This mystical interpreter is an F# binding file, a scroll of code that whispers the secrets of JavaScript to the F# compiler.

Crafting these binding scrolls is no mere task, but a journey of intricate artistry.
As fortune would have it, the ancient maps of TypeScript definition files light our path, offering a beacon of inspiration.
Our adventure leads us to the shores of [Glutinum](https://github.com/glutinum-org/cli), a mystical tool, born from the alchemy of converting TypeScript's knowledge into F# bindings.

This odyssey and the tales of Glutinum's powers are chronicled in the sacred texts of the Fable annals, which await your perusal on the hallowed [Fable blog](https://fable.io/blog/2024/2024-01-01-Glutinum_a_new_era.html).

> Glutinum, a new era for Fable bindings

Join us, and be part of this extraordinary session, where the magic of Fable comes alive through the words and wisdom of the remarkable Maxime!
