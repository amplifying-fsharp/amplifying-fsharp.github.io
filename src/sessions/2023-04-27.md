## Premise

Amplifying F# is not limited to virtual stream sessions only. We like to connect to developers in the physical world as well.
The F# developers over at the Norwegian Broadcast Company (NRK) are interested in contributing to open-source

## Workshop

In this workshop, the developers at NRK got an overview on the implications of using open-source software.  
What the benefits and the risks are. And how contributing back is a way to mitigate potential risks.

After some theory, we got our hands dirty and started contributing to the various F# projects of interest.
