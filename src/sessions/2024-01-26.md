## Here be dragons

When fsih was first showcased in our [Unlocking F# Potential](https://amplifyingfsharp.io/sessions/2023/11/24/) session, the goal to get this integrated in [fsi](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tools/fsharp-interactive/) itself was already set.  
With version 1.0 of Fsih out there, it's finally time to make the first step and explore the unknown land of fsi code:

- Is it possible at all?
- What would the integration in the existing code look like?
- Can we keep the same user experience?

Join us for this exploratory session and let's try to find some answers together.
