## Problem

Developers expect a large set of ready-to-use code-fixes and automatic refactoring features from their development environments.
FsAutoComplete offers already a big set but there are still a few essential ones missing.

## Expected behavior

All essential code-fixes and automatic refactoring features are offered by FsAutoComplete. We won't reach this goal in this session, but we'll make a little bit of progress.

The code-fix I want to add in this session is `add private accessibility modifier`.  
Given code like the following:

```fsharp
module MyModule =

    let helper x = x + 10

    let f x = helper x

MyModule.f 10
```

A code-fix should be offered when the cursor is in the `helper` binding to get:

```fsharp
module MyModule =

    let private helper x = x + 10

    let f x = helper x

MyModule.f 10
```

Later on this can be expanded to other language elements which support the accessibility modifier.
