## Topic

Dave Dawkins was inspired by Tomas Petricek's [Tiny Systems course](https://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/teaching/nprg077/) to create a browser based development environment.  
He created a parser, added the Monaco editor, syntax highlighting, an in-browser file explorer and an AST explorer.  
No server is required, the whole environment runs in the browser. Everything is written in F#, using Fable, and the UI is Sutil.

Join us for a deep dive into this awesome application of F# tools and learn something along the way about the implementation of programming languages and tooling.
