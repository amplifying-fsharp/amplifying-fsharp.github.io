## Problem

In [fsprojects/FSharp.Formatting#778](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Formatting/issues/778) it has been brought up that the user-experience of large API documenation page could be improved upon.

![Large API page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6868833/201503980-bae61b16-b4ee-4e57-81a4-7aaf4233b1f2.png)

## Expected behavior

We'll explore our options and see how we can tackle this UX problem.  
This will be a great case-study how we can contribute to the popular [FSharp.Formattting](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/) documentation.
