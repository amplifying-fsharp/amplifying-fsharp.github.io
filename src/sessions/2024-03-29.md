## Introduction

[FsToolkit.ErrorHandling](https://github.com/demystifyfp/FsToolkit.ErrorHandling) has become a staple in the F# community for handling the [Result](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/results) type and making [Railway-Oriented-Programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/) a breeze. It has been [used in many projects](https://github.com/demystifyfp/FsToolkit.ErrorHandling/network/dependents) and has been a great library for many developers. At the time of writing it has 3.4 million downloads on Nuget for the [main package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FsToolkit.ErrorHandling) and 2.2 million for the [TaskResult package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FsToolkit.ErrorHandling.TaskResult). A big thank you for all the users and [contributors](https://github.com/demystifyfp/FsToolkit.ErrorHandling/graphs/contributors) to the project!

## Topic

[Version 5.0](https://github.com/demystifyfp/FsToolkit.ErrorHandling/milestone/2) is on the horizon! This will have many breaking changes and their reasons why. We'll cover all that is going into the release such as:

- Removing Ply from the project
- Moving `TaskResult` into the Core Library and deprecating `FsToolkit.ErrorHandling.TasksResult` package.
- Allowing `netstandard2.0` to deal with `IAsyncEnumerable`/`IAsyncDisposable`
- Fixing overload resolution
- What does god need with a starship?
- Removing/changing `and!` for `AsyncResult` and `TaskResult`

We'll also look into merging outstanding PRs and working on remaining issues.
