## Topic

One can do a lot of great things with F#: Backends, frontends, data science, crazy math stuff, write your own language, solvers, parsers, do every-day-stuff, automation, scripting, show your colleagues that you can do all that stuff better and easier using F#, and be annoyed that no one wants to believe you.

And there's one more thing: You can use F# to write animated PXL-Art in only a few lines of code! It's super low-barrier and enjoyable! Use your programming skills to get some neat colourful work done in an hour or two, without requiring to study art or game design.

Ronald invites you to look, listen - and get your hands dirty - all during this session :)

[Here's](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ed5sbd47tn774s7nfvx3xwlg/post/3lgapvktjyc23) an impression of how such an app could look like.
