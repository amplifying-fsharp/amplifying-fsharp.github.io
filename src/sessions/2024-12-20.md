## Topic

This session will try to provide a practical introduction to F# and use the [SAFE template](https://github.com/SAFE-Stack/SAFE-template) as a scaffold. Itâ€™ll cover essential concepts and tools, focusing on building, testing, and deploying an F# project. The session will also guide participants through customizing a web project with their chosen stack.

Goals to deliver:

1. F# Fundamentals and Tooling

   - Understanding the Basics: Get familiar with the dotnet CLI and explore the structure of .fsproj files. Compare F#'s dependency relationships to languages like C#, Java, C/C++, and OCaml.

   - Tool Relationships: Clarify the roles of key tools like FAKE, NuGet, and Paket. Learn when to use dotnet CLI, MSBuild, FAKE, or other tools for building your project.

   - Frontend Overview: A brief dive into frontend tools like Fable and Elmish, exploring their role in an F# project.

2. Recommend a web stack for beginners

    - Stack Customization: Showcasing how to tailor an existing SAFE template or project to fit the needs
    - Deployment Demo: A step-by-step walkthrough of deploying the modified project.
