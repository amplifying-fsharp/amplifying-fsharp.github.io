## Topic

This session will try to provide a practical introduction to F# and use the SAFE template as a scaffold. We’ll cover essential concepts and tools, focusing on building, testing, and deploying an F# project. The session will also guide participants through customizing a web project with their chosen stack.

What We'll Cover:
1. F# Fundamentals and Tooling

- **Understanding the Basics**: Get familiar with the dotnet CLI and explore the structure of .fsproj files. We'll compare F#'s dependency relationships to languages like C#, Java, C/C++, and OCaml.
- **Tool Relationships**: Clarify the roles of key tools like FAKE, NuGet, and Paket. Learn when to use dotnet CLI, MSBuild, FAKE, or other tools for building your project.
- **Frontend Overview**: A brief dive into frontend tools like Fable and Elmish, exploring their role in an F# project.
Many beginners find starting an F# project challenging, especially when navigating tool choices or customizing templates. This session will demystify these decisions and equip you with a clear roadmap for your first F# web project.

2. Recommending and Demonstrating a Beginner-Friendly Web Stack
After building foundational knowledge, we’ll transition to modifying the SAFE-Store project to reflect a beginner-friendly stack. This will include:

- **Stack Customization**: Showcasing how to tailor an existing SAFE template or project to fit your needs.
- **Deployment Demo**: A step-by-step walkthrough of deploying the modified project.
By the end of the session, participants will have a deeper understanding of F#, the SAFE stack, and how to confidently start and customize their own web projects.
