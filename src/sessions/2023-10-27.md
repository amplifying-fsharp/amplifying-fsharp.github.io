## Topic

In recent times, the need for analyzers in the F# world has become more and more apparent.  
Luckily the F# team already has the creation of an infrastructure for that on it's [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/projects/126/views/40?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Analyzers+SDK).  
But there's actually already an SDK from the Ionide project to write analyzers today.  
We worked quite a lot on it in the last couple of weeks to ease the waiting time till the official one is available.  
We also wanted to collect use cases and requirements that we can then share with the F# team.

In this session, we will show

- how to create an analyzer from scratch with the latest SDK
- how to use the SDK test infrastructure
- how to integrate analyzers in your CI
- how to integrate analyzers with GitHub [code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning)
