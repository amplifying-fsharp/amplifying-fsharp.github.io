## Topic

In this session, we address the issue of the `Obsolete` attribute being ignored in constructor property assignment.
In the following example, the `IgnoreNullValues` property is marked as obsolete, but it is still being used in the constructor.

```fsharp

    System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions(JsonSerializerDefaults.Web, IgnoreNullValues = true)

```

### Expected behavior:

The compiler should raise a warning or error when the `IgnoreNullValues` property is used in the constructor.

### Actual behavior:

The `Obsolete` attribute is ignored in the constructor property assignment.
