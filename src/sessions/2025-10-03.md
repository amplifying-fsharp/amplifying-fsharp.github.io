## Topic

.NET 10 will support [file-based apps](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-run-app/) for C#. This means that you can run a source file app.cs by dotnet run app.cs without the need to create a project file or to deal with artifacts. The source file can contain directives for referencing packages or adding build properties. When the need arises, you can automatically create a whole conventional project from it by dotnet project convert. So, this is a nice way to create small tools, and certainly a good way to introduce newcomers to the language. The [runfs](https://github.com/Martin521/Runfs?tab=readme-ov-file#runfs) project demonstrates similar functionality for F#.

The aim of this session is also to serve as a community discussion around if F# needs file-based apps.
