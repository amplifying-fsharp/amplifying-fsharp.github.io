## Topic

F# is a great language to model domains. It's features allow us to fearlessly take on more than the usual ToDo demo.  
In this session Oskar will share his experience of using F# to model the domain of auctions.
A domain you can easily read up on that contains some of the complexities you might encounter while working on real systems that are not simple CRUD applications that requires a bit more validation and logic.
