## Topic

In a previous session, [Petr Pokorny](https://github.com/0101) showed off the new [Transparent compiler](https://amplifyingfsharp.io/sessions/2023/12/01/) in the [FSharp.Compiler.Service](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-compiler-docs/tooling-features.html) with many benefits to performance and debugging. It's time to put it to the test in [FsAutocomplete](https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete)! We'll explore the current state of the API by seeing how it can be used to improve the experience of [Ionide](https://ionide.io/).
