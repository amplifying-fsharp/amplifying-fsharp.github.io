The Europe-based part of us made the trip to Berlin to attend the [Data Science in F#](https://datascienceinfsharp.com/) conference.  
First of all, we want to give a big shoutout to the organizers for putting together the first real live F# conference after many years.
Everyone was thrilled to have the opportunity to meet in person and share a drink .. or two .. or ..

Being mostly involved with dev tooling so far, it was a real eye opener for us to see and meet the Data Science community of F#.  
In the discussions a lot of opportunities for collaboration came up, and we are looking forward to working with the [Fslab](https://fslab.org/) community to help them with their wonderful F# ecosystem for Data Science. The dominance of Python in the Data Science space is unlikely to go away soon, but there is a strong believe that F# deserves a strong foot hold in the Data Science world. A very well prepared hackathon on Saturday helped new contributors to get started and has already resulted in a number of PRs.

Regarding Amplifying F# itself, we are very happy to welcome [Ronald Schlenker](https://github.com/RonaldSchlenker) in our team.
A great buddy and a great F# developer known for his work on [FsHttp](https://github.com/fsprojects/FsHttp), [Vide](https://github.com/RonaldSchlenker/Vide), and many other projects.

Fueled by coffee and ice cream, many ideas to take the next steps in our initiative and to lift Amplifying F# to the next level came up during the conference.  
Stay tuned for more news in the coming weeks.
