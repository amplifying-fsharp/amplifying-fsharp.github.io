  <h2>How can I join?</h2>
  <p>
    Our goal with <strong>Amplifying F#</strong> is to connect contributors and work
    towards solutions.<br />
    We aim to bring together people to work on specific issues. <em
      >Do you have an itch you want to scratch?</em
    ><br />
    Great, let us know what that itch is and we can schedule a session ðŸš€!
  </p>
  <h2 id="free">Wait, is this free?</h2>
  <p>
    No, it's not. You <strong>pay</strong> with your <strong>time</strong>. Or
    more specifically, your company grants you the time to work on this. That is
    really the aim of our initiave: companies giving back to F#<br />
    We won't solve any problems for you. Your participation is expected and thus
    there is no escape that you will need to invest time into this.
