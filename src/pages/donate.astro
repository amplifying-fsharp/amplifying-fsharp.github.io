  <p>
    Running Amplifying F# involves certain fixed costs, including domain names,
    various services, and travel expenses.
    <br />
    If you believe youâ€™ve gained value from our initiative, please consider making
    a donation.
  </p>
  <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
  <p>
    Previously, we had grand ambitions for our Open Collective. In our wildest
    dreams, we envisioned a world where we could start paying developers like a
    real job and see F# flourish. Of course, this was a set of lofty
    expectations, and we knew it was unlikely to happen. So, we established more
    attainable goals that could also be achieved with a smaller amount of money.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, there is a critical amount of funding needed before you can
    make a significant impact in open-source. A $10 donation to an individual
    developer may be a thoughtful gesture, and it's great to continue supporting
    them in that way, but in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't lead to
    substantial change.
  </p>
  <p>
    What we want to convey is that, for now, we are pausing our larger plans
    with Open Collective.
    <br /> This means we are not actively utilizing the funds for new initiatives.
    We are using it to keep the lights on, but nothing more.
  </p>
  <p>
    That being said, you can still donate to us; we just want to manage your
    expectations a bit.
    <br /> If you have any thoughts or suggestions, please feel free to reach out
    to us via <a href="mailto:amplifyingfsharp@gmail.com">email</a>.
