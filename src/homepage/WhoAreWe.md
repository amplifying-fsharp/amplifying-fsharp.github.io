We are a group of **independent individuals**, not tied to any organisation, with an **ambition to see `F#` grow**.  
What brought us together is our aspiration to make an **actual difference** in the **F# open-source** landscape.  
United, we can take this F# ecosystem to the next level. By **hands-on collaboration** and targeted efforts.

## Enter the hive

The world of _open-source software can be quite overwhelming_ to get your feet wet in. There is a lot to learn, and you might not be confident that you can actually contribute code changes.

Just like when starting a new job, you need to learn a new codebase. An open-source project is no different. You can read more about this experience in [Edgar's testimonial](/testimonials/edgargonzalez/).

And that is why we want to invoke our collective hive-mind to help people get started.
We want to guide you as best as we can to scratch your own itch in the open-source space.
